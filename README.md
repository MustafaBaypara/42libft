hey !!  


we have a Makefile file in repo for to keep all files in a singe file (40+ .c file in 1 .a file)  

and  

.h file is a library file, it has a lot of function define  


we can compile main.c file, main.c has #include "libft.h"  

and  

compile! with;   

cc main.c libft.a  


cc (compiler)  
main.c(main file)   
libft.a (all lib files needed in archived with Makefile);
